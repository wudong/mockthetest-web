            <p class="lead">Being a <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" target="_blank">web application</a>,
                our website differs from most other websites that
                provide service for the life in the uk test.
            </p>
            <p >It is more than static
                web pages that simply give the questions and answers to you;
                it is a piece of software that could prepare you for the test in a more effective way.
                However, to make the best use of it, <strong>please</strong> read the following guide to make sense of
                the functions we provide.
            </p>

            <p class="feature_text ">
                <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
                To start with, you can use the <a href="/question-browse">question browser</a>
                to browse all the questions in our
                question bank. Within it, you can browse the question page by page, search question by keywords, by categories,
                or by tags. You can also answer questions while you are browsing, and the answering
                will be saved automatically for you as part of your practice history.
            </p>

            <p class="feature_text ">
                <i class="fa fa-book fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
                The <a href="/question-practise">question practice</a> function
                allow you to practise with the questions in a systematic way.
                You do not want to practice with the questions that you have answered correctly
                again and again while omitting the questions you found difficult. This is what
                likely happens in the  <a href="/question-browse"> question browser</a> and in most other websites.
                With our question practice function, question is presented one by one, in an order according to your
                <strong>practice history</strong>, so that you could get more
                chance to practise with the questions that are difficult to you, and remember them better.
                <strong>This is the recommended approach to use our website.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="feature_text ">
                <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
                The <a href="/question-test">test simulator</a>
                gives you the feeling of how
                a real life test will be alike. It is similar to the <a href="/question-practise">question practice</a> function but you will not be able to see
                any feedback of your answers until you finished and submitted. You could use it to evaluate your
                capability as to the test because all the questions presented in the test simulator are from
                <strong>real test</strong> (reported by people who has taken the test)!
            </p>

            <p class="feature_text ">
                <i class="fa fa-bookmark fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i> The <span class="text-info">bookmark function</span>
                provides a convenient way to keep records of the questions you feel difficult, important, and/or uncertain
                (or whatever you feel really). We also have many ways to let you <span class="text-info">review</span>
                the questions from different
                angles: you can review the questions that you practised wrong,
                that we feel they are difficult for you, that you bookmarked, and so on.
            </p>

            <p class="feature_text ">
                <i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
                The <span class="text-info">information panel</span> helps you keep track of your practice.
                It gives you the detail information on how many questions you have answered,
                how many you have done right, wrong, and how many you have marked as important. These information
                is given for the current session of practice, or if you are a login user, for all the practice
                you have done. Best of all, you can easily start reviewing all your questions from there.
                You can also see your overall progress there and determine if it is a right time to start booking
                the test!
            </p>

            An important <strong>rule of thumb</strong>: if you are unsure of a question, always bookmark it before try answering.
            In this way, you can save the question for later review, or you will lose it if you fluke it right.
